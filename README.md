## HLU and OSMM merge: a brief guide to the code

These rough notes describe how to use the set of python scripts
developed by Alison Smith and Martin Besnier at the Environmental Change
Institute, University of Oxford, for creating a habitat base map suitable for
natural capital mapping. The scripts are research tools and have not been
rigorously tested or documented.

The tools are designed to work with OS Mastermap (OSMM) as the base map. They
then merge in a Phase 1 habitat map. The code is set up to work with the Phase 1
habitat and land use (HLU) map for Oxfordshire, provided under license from the
Thames Valley Record Centre (TVERC). However, it should be possible to use any
similar datasets by modifying the input parameters for the main merge script,
and possibly modifying the pre- and post-processing steps to work with the
habitat classifications in the alternative datasets (if they differ).

The most straightforward way to merge together two or more habitat datasets
would be though a series of Intersect or Identity operations in ArcGIS. However,
the habitat datasets we work with tend to have boundaries that do not exactly
match OS Mastermap boundaries. Therefore this method, when performed at county
scale, creates tens of thousands of tiny 'slivers' at polygon edges, which can
cause problems when attempting to perform subsequent geoprocessing operations.

The novel aspect of the code (designed originally by Martin Besnier, a visiting
researcher from the UniversitÃ© Paris Sud) is that it merges two polygon datasets
(a base map and a set of new features), while avoiding the creation of an
excessive number of slivers due to boundary mismatch. It does this through
identifying polygons in the base map that need to be split to match the
boundaries of the new features, while ignoring minor differences in the
boundaries due to inaccurate mapping (which would generate slivers). The output
is faithful to the base map boundaries as far as possible, though minor
differences (just a few cm) may arise during one of the sliver elimination
steps.

A sequence of scripts have been developed which:

1.  pre-process the OSMM and habitat input maps (e.g. to remove duplicate and
    overlapping features);
2.  merge the two polygon datasets together without generating too many slivers;
3.  generate a unified 'Interpreted habitat' attribute field that uses a set of
    rules to identify the habitat based on information from both OSMM and the
    habitat map;

These three scripts, plus a `MyFunctions` script containing frequently used
custom-built functions, form the core of the habitat base map generation.
Further scripts (not described in this document) have also been developed that
merge in Agricultural Land Class, fifteen different habitat designation
datasets, OS Mastermap Greenspace and OS Open Greenspace, and public access
information, to create a more detailed natural capital base map.

### Instructions for running the code

1.  All the scripts should be in the same folder as the `MyFunctions.py` script,
    which supplies useful common functions. For each stage of the process, edit
    the script to set the workspace directory and all the other parameters, and
    run the code. Check the outputs carefully.

2.  The code is set up to work for two main options:

    a.  Phase 1 habitat data is available

    b.  Phase 1 habitat data not available - use CEH Land Cover Map and Natural
        England Priority Habitat data instead.

    > We currently run the scripts for Oxfordshire first, using Phase 1 data, and
    > then run for the rest of the Arc using LCM / PHI data.

3.  Download the geodatabase version of OSMM topographic area from Edina Digimap
    or OS (assuming you have a license). Do not use a shapefile version, as
    field names get truncated and code does not work.

#### Using Phase 1 habitat data

1.  Check habitat data (e.g. Oxfordshire Phase 1 HLU) for 'unidentified'
    habitats, and use BAP or other info to determine what they are - otherwise
    delete them (OSMM definition will be used instead). Check for incorrect
    spellings in Phase1habitat field (duplicates with upper and lower case can
    be left in, as they should be resolved by the code).
2.  Open the `Merge_OSMM_HLU_Preprocess.py` script:

    -   Set the workspace gdb path in the code (NB - it is faster to run this on
        your hard drive rather than a network server). The code currently
        expects a geodatabase called Merge_OSMM_HLU.gdb.

    -   Depending on what steps you want to run, change the flags in the
        parameter section to True or False. If the files have not been clipped
        to the exact boundaries, set 'clip_to_boundary' to True, name the
        input files HLU_in and OSMM_in, add boundary file to the gdb and set
        the name of the boundary feature class (e.g. "Oxfordshire") as a
        parameter in the code. Otherwise the code expects the input files to be
        named HLU and OSMM (this can be changed in the parameter section).

    -   Run the script. This erases manmade features and water from HLU, removes
        overlaps and eliminates slivers, checks and repairs geometry; removes
        overlapping features (landforms and pylons) from OSMM; and removes
        unnecessary fields (enter the list of habitat fields to keep in the
        script: currently POLY_ID, PHASE1HABI, BAP_HABITA, "BAP_HABI00",
        "SITEREF", "COPYRIGHT", "VERSION").

3.  **Merge_into_Base_MapV5a.py:** open the script, *set the merge_type
    parameter to "OSMM_HLU"*, check the workspace and all the other parameters
    and run the code. This can take about 14 hours for merging HLU habitat data
    into OSMM for the whole of Oxfordshire.

4.  **OSMM_HLU_Interpret.py**: *set 'region' to 'Oxon'*. This adds the habitat
    interpretations, by combining OSMM and Phase 1 appropriately. Note: If OSMM
    is "undefined" this usually means the area is under development or
    scheduled for development. The 'undefined_or_original' flag allows the
    user to choose whether to map these areas as "undefined" or as the current
    / original habitat pre-development.

#### Using CEH Land cover map and NE PHI data

(These scripts not yet uploaded to GitHub but can be on request)

1.  All scripts run in a loop through LADs (leaving out Oxfordshire LADs as we
    do that separately).
2.  **Prep_OSMM.py** - copies tiles from download folders into a single
    folder, merges into a single feature class in a geodatabase, and clips to
    LAD boundaries.
3.  **Setup_LAD_gdbs.py**. Has several stages - set any that are not needed
    to 'False'. At present it is set to ignore Oxfordshire as we have a separate
    procedure for generating the Oxfordshire data, using Phase 1 habitat.

    1.  Prepare PHI data. There are three separate datasets - the main PHI
        data, plus Wood Pasture and Parkland (WPP) and Open Mosaic Habitats on
        previously developed land (OMHD). For all three datasets, dissolve on
        habitat field (Main_habit or PRIHABTXT), convert to single part, delete
        polygons <10m2, and copy habitat field to new field called 'PHI', 'WPP'
        or 'OMHD'. Then union all three datasets. WPP and OHMD are not very
        accurate, e.g. WPP maps whole parkland areas with a mix of habitats
        including grass, fields, woods, buildings and plantations, and often
        overlaps with other PHIs. So let OSMM woodland, water, manmade and other
        PHI habitats take priority.

    2.  Set up individual geodatabases for each LAD:
        1.  Create new gdb
        2. Copy in the OSMM data for this LAD
        3. Create boundary feature
        4. Clip Arc-wide LCM and PHI data to the boundaries of the LAD,
            and copy in.

4.  **OSMM_HLU_Interpret.py** - *set 'region' to 'Arc', and 'simplify_OSMM'
    to True but other stages to False*. This will interpret a simplified habitat
    from the OSMM Make, Descriptive Group and Descriptive Term.

5.  **METHOD 1 (intersect PHI). Run Arc_LCM_PHI.py** - combines with CEH land
    cover map and Natural England priority habitat data. Set
    'merge_or_intersect' = "intersect". There are two main stages:

    1.  Process_LCM: Add data from CEH Landcover Map 2015 by defining
        agricultural land or 'general surface natural' as either arable or
        improved grassland. Then create a joint 'Interpreted habitat' field that
        assigns either the OSMM habitat or the LCM habitat.

    2.  Process_PHI: delete landforms from OSMM data, intersect (using
        'Identity') with PHI data, then interpret PHI by copying to Interpreted
        Habitat but only when OSMM is not manmade, garden or water. For WPP and
        OMHD, keep fine detail of other habitats and only copy these
        designations across for generic habitats (e.g. farmland). PHI boundaries
        match OSMM quite well, though with some genuine split polygons, so the
        intersect (Identity) doesn not create too many slivers, e.g. Aylesbury
        goes from 455 single part slivers (<1m2) for OSMM_LCM to 2372 after
        intersect with PHI, which is not too bad out of approx. 400,000
        polygons. However, if time, it is neater to use the alternative method
        (step 6).

6.  **METHOD 2 (merge PHI) ALTERNATIVE to step 5:** Merge rather than
    intersecting PHI, to reduce slivers. For example, this only increases
    slivers from 455 to 457 (single part) for Aylesbury. There are relatively
    few PHI polygons so the Merge does not take too long - about 50 minutes per
    LAD, 12 hours for all LADs (except Oxfordshire). To do this,

    1.  run `Arc_LCM_PHI.py` with `merge_or_intersect = "merge"` and `step =
        1`. This should set `intersect_PHI` and `interpret_PHI` to False but all
        other steps to True,

    2.  run `Merge_into_Base_Map.py` with `merge-type` set to `Arc_LCM_PHI`,

    3.  re-run `Arc_LCM_PHI.py` with 'step = 2'. This should set `process_PHI`
        and `interpret_PHI` to `True` and all other stages to `False`, to copy
        the correct habitat interpretation across from the PHI, WPP and OMHD
        fields to the `Interpreted_habitat` field.

### Merging OSMM and HLU - method notes

The method is based around a 'tabulate intersection' step to determine the
percentage of new feature polygons within base map polygons.

#### Prepare datasets

`Merge_OSMM_HLU_ Preprocess.py`

Delete OSMM landforms; delete HLU overlaps; erase manmade and water from HLU.

1.  Optional stage: clip to exact boundary of study area.
2.  Optional stage: delete unnecessary attribute fields.
3.  Delete landforms from OSMM -> OSMM_noLandform NOTE: Pylons also
    overlap - originally these were not removed but I changed this as it was
    causing problems later in the code.
4.  Delete HLU water features so we don't get remnants left over later
    which obscure OSMM islands.
5.  Erase OSMM manmade (buildings, roads, tracks) and water from HLU ->
    HLU_Manerase Roadside is not erased, as this misses some semi-natural
    grassland and scrub etc.
6.  Correct HLU overlaps with Union.
    > Note: this code may crash at the Union stage - if this happens, the union
    can be done manually in ArcGIS and the code can be re-started.
7.  HLU multipart to singlepart
8.  Eliminate HLU overlap slivers (less than 1m2 - was originally also OR
    length/area >3 but I have removed this as I am not convinced it does not
    delete useful polygons.) This stage also deletes the small sliver gaps.
9.  Delete remaining HLU stand-alone slivers
10. Delete remaining gaps (i.e. those that are genuine gaps, not slivers).
11. Delete identical shapes. If there are duplicate shapes with different
    habitats (there are a few of these in the Oxfordshire dataset) only one of
    these will be kept.

Examples from the South Abingdon / North Drayton area. Left: Original HLU layer
omits urban areas and some water features. Middle: OSMM includes urban areas and
woodland detail but not type of grassland. Right: pre-processed HLU
(HLU_Manerase) with manmade and water features erased, revealing shapes of lake
and new housing estate.

#### Main merge code - `merge_into_base_map_V5a.py`

First set up the input parameters in the first block of code. The steps in the
main code are described below.

The code is designed to loop through a set of geodatabases, which we used for
the different Local Authority Districts within the Oxford-Cambridge Arc. However
it also works with only one geodatabase (which we used for Oxfordshire).

### Snap new features (e.g. HLU) to match base map features (e.g. OSMM) better

1.  Only snap polygons that are not already identical (though only around 2000
    out of 80000 HLU polygons are identical to OSMM after the pre-processing).
2.  Snap new features to base map. Snap parameters are set up in the parameter
    input section. We use dmall snap distances (0.5 or 1m) to avoid distorting
    the edges of small linear features such as rides.
3.  Correct overlaps created by the snapping process, by unioning and then
    deleting identical polygons.
4.  Clean slivers from the snapped new features, by: a.  Eliminating slivers
    less than 1m2 b.  Deleting stand-alone slivers <1m2

This is the most time-consuming part of the code -it can take 12 hours for a
county the size of Oxfordshire. We experimented with densifying the two datasets
before the snap, but this does not always work well and makes the snap operation
even longer. Also it loses the original curves, replacing them with a series of
short straight lines, and results in very large datasets (with far more points
than previously).

### Decide which OSMM polygons should be split to include new HLU features

1.  Save OBJECTID attribute and polygon areas to new attribute fields, for both
    the base map (Base_ID) and the new features (New_ID). These saved IDs will
    be used later, to transfer attributes across to the new merged shapes.

2.  Use ArcGIS Tabulate intersection function to create a table with the
    percentage overlaps between the base map and the new features.

3.  Create a new 'Relationship' attribute in the Tabluate Intersection table
    ("Base_TI") and use this to store the decision of whether or not to split
    polygons, based on a set of rules. Small overlaps are ignored, but larger
    overlaps mean that the base map (OSMM) polygon will be split (intersected
    with the new feature polygon outlines). However very large overlaps mean
    that the polygon will not be aplit, as the whole polygon will be assumed to
    match the new feature. The input spatial parameters ignore_low and
    ignore_high determine the threshold overlaps for ignoring or splitting
    polygons. There is also an overlap size threshold (significant_size), above
    which polygons will be split even if the overlap is small.

    a.  Very small overlap, less than ignore_low (default 5%) AND overlap_area
        < significant size (default 200 m2): ignore the new feature (habitat
        will remain same as base map). Relationship attribute set to 'Base'.

    b.  Overlap between ignore_low and ignore_high (default 5-95%): split the
        polygon so that the new feature outline is included within the base map
        polygon. Relationship attribute set to 'Split'.

    c.  Very large overlap, greater than ignore_high (default 95%) - set the
        whole polygon to the same habitat as the new feature. Relationship
        attribute set to 'New'.

**Examples: OSMM outlines in black and HLU outlines in red (selected HLU
polygons in Cyan).**

**Example 1:**

The large HLU arable polygon (Cyan outline) contains 4 medium-sized OSMM fields
plus a very small OSMM field. The four medium OSMM fields and the small field
all fit exactly into the HLU polygon so there is no need to split them.

<image src="images/image4.png" width="400" />

**Example 2:**

The HLU polygon (Cyan outline) isbetween 5% and 95% of the OSMM polygon, so the
OSMM polygon will be split.

<image src="images/image5.png" width="400" />

**Example 3. HLU (main area); OSMM (smaller area)**

The HLU woodland polygon (Cyan outline) is smaller than the OSMM scrub /
woodland polygon but this is due to inaccurate mapping of the boundary. The
overlap is less than the 95% threshold, so the whole polygon is assigned to the
HLU habitat, and it is not split unless any of the smaller parts are greater
than the 'significant size' threshold (default 200m2).

<image src="images/image6.png" width="400" />

**Example 4:**

**Top part**: a HLU 'improved grassland' field is split into a number of smaller
OSMM areas including an area of scattered trees. These are all completely within
the HLU field so they are not split. The small block of woodland (1) and the small
field (2) next to it are assigned the OSMM classification later.

**Lower part**: an OSMM field is split into two HLU fields and includes a patch
of OSMM trees (3) in the north half which is not in HLU, and a HLU marsh (4) in the
lower half that is not included in OSMM.

The top half of the field is interpreted as the HLU neutral grassland. The small
woodland will become OSMM woodland. The lower part of the field and the marsh
are also assigned the HLU habitat types.

### Add new HLU features to the OSMM base map (combine geometry)

We start from a clean copy of OSMM and modify it to include the new feature
(HLU) polygons where they are justifiably different from OSMM - in other words
the rows marked 'Split' in the tabulated intersection tables.

We have to be very careful here, because each base map (OSMM) polygon can have
multiple corresponding rows in the Tabulate Intersection table, if the overlaps
with the new features are complex. So some of the table joins are 'one to many'
joins, which we have to be very careful with.

1.  Make a copy of the Tabulate_Intersection table, selecting only the rows for
    the polygons to be split.

2.  For the polygons that we do not want to split (because they are over 95%
    overlapped by a new feature polygon), we need to make sure that the only the
    habitat attributes from the largest overlapping new feature are included
    (not any smaller ones round the edges). So make another copy of the Tabulate
    Intersection table for the un-split polygons, sort it by size, and delete
    those with a duplicate Base_ID (this is what we set up earlier, by copying
    the original ObjectID). This keeps only the details for the main new habitat
    within that base map polygon.

3.  Make a clean copy of the base map (OSMM) and add a 'Relationship' attribute
    field.

4.  Join this to the table of split polygons, based on the Base ID, and set
    'Relationship' to 'Split' for all those rows. This identifies all the base
    map (OSMM) polygons that need to be split.

5.  Make a clean copy of the new features (HLU) and join it to the table of
    split polygons, using the new feature ID (New_ID). This identifies all the
    new feature polygons that will form part of the new outlines in the merged
    file.

6.  Select the new feature polygons marked 'split', and clip them using the
    outline of the base map polygons to be split. This will produce a set of new
    shapes to be merged into the base map, which we call 'Joint_spatial_clip'.

7.  Union these new shapes (which may be only partial, e.g. half of an OSMM
    field) into the base map polygons that they are splitting. This produces the
    new shapes for the split polygons, with both the base map attributes and
    (for the parts that are split), the new feature attributes.

8.  Caution: This is the brain-melting bit. There are now two copies of the
    Relationship field - one from the unioned base map, with all rows 'split',
    and one from the clipped new features, with some polygons marked 'split'
    and some either null or blank. Some of the split polygons may have a large
    part that was tagged 'new' (because the overlap percentage was very high
    but there were also smaller parts of the same polygon that were tagged for
    splitting because they exceeded the significant size). So we now want to
    match the non-split parts of these polygons (joined in via the Union) with
    the correct ID from the TI table, so that attributes can be transferred
    later. We do this by sorting both the TI tables and the unioned clip file by
    size, and then joining the tables so that the split polygon parts are
    matched with the intersections of the same size, and copying the ID across.

9.  Clean the clipped shapes, by eliminating and deleting slivers. This is the
    step where eliminating slivers may lead to small deviations from the
    integrity of the base map boundaries, including small polygons (< 1m2) in
    the original base map.

10. Another complicated bit. Create a tag 'Not new' to identify the parts of the
    split polygons that are base map only, i.e. *not* part of the new features.
    This is needed when transferring the new feature attributes back into the
    merged shapes, in step 13.

11. Erase the base map with the new joint shapes, and then merge the new shapes
    back into the base map. This has created a version of the base map that has
    polygons split where necessary to match the new features.

12. Convert to single part, check and repair geometry.

### Transfer attributes from OSMM and HLU to OSMM_HLU layer

13. The merged dataset contains the base map attributes for all polygons, and
    the polygons that were split also contain the new feature attributes.
    However we now need to add the new feature attributes for the polygons that
    were not split but were marked as 'new', via a table join. This is a one to
    many join - each base polygon could be overlapped by more than one new
    feature polygon, but as these polygons were not marked for splitting, we
    want to use the ID of the largest intersection (i.e. ignoring slivers and
    insignificant areas) so we sort by size. The table join is done in two
    stages, because `Relationship <> 'Not new'` excludes NULLs.

14. The next few steps are a bit complicated but the end result is that all the
    attributes for the new features have been copied across to the appropriate
    polygons in the merged dataset.

### Interpreting data: `OSMM_HLU.py`

This script assigns an overall habitat classification to each polygon as
follows.

1.  The OS mastermap attributes Descriptive Group, Descriptive Term and Make are
    used to assign new attribute field 'OSMM_hab'.
2.  The Phase 1 habitat data (from the HLU habitat dataset) is used to assign
    new attribute field 'HLU_hab'.
3.  The habitat based on a combination of OSMM and HLU is stored in 'Interpreted
    Habitat'
4.  The BAP classification (also from the HLU habitat dataset) modifies this
    where applicable, resulting in the final habitat interpretation in
    'BAP_interpretation'.

It uses a fairly complex set of rules. It would need to be adapted if there are
habitats present that we have not included, e.g. heather and bog.
